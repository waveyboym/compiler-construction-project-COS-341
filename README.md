# Compiler Construction Project

## Pre-requisites
1. Download and install <a href="https://www.oracle.com/za/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk22-windows">Java development kit</a>
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You cannot proceed past this point if you don't have java installed

## How do I run it?
You can run either the <a href="#run-jar-file">pre-compiled binary</a> or <a href="#run-scripts">compile and run the program yourself</a>

### Run jar file
1. Open up a terminal and run:
```
java -jar app.jar input/main.spl
```

### Run scripts
1. if you are on windows, open a terminal and run:
```
run.bat
```
otherwise if you are on linux, run:
```
./run.sh
```
> [!NOTE]  
> You may have to grant run permissions to the bash or bat files

> [!WARNING]  
> It is always good practice to read and make sure you understand what the bat/bash file will do on your system before just running it.
